# **Nihon Dojo**

## **Overview**
Nihon Dojo is a no-nonsense Japanese learning app that actually gets you fluent. While other apps waste your time with cartoon mascots and meaningless streaks, we built something that works. Two-year fluency guarantee or full refund. Simple as that.

This is the marketing landing page for the Nihon Dojo mobile app, available on iOS and Android.

## **The Two-Year Fluency Guarantee**
Use Nihon Dojo every day for two years. Follow the system. Do the reviews. If you're not conversationally fluent, we'll refund every penny.

Most apps won't make this promise because they know their cute gamification doesn't work. We will, because we built tools that do.

## **Why Nihon Dojo Is Different**

### **Real Spaced Repetition That Works**
We use the FSRS algorithm, not some watered-down knockoff. It will make you review words until you hate them, then review them more. No participation trophies.

### **Context That Actually Helps**
We generate sentences using only words you've already learned. Revolutionary concept, we know. No more example sentences filled with 20 different N1 words you've never seen before.

### **Formality You Can Actually Use**
Our built-in formality switching teaches you how Japanese people actually talk. Or if you're business-oriented, we can do the opposite: turn you so textbook you'll be saying „Åï„Åõ„Å¶„ÅÑ„Åü„Å†„Åç„Åæ„Åô in your sleep.

## **Who This Is For**
