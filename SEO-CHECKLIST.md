## ðŸŽ¯ Target Keywords to Focus On

Based on your marketing content, optimize for:
- "AI mixing assistant"
- "DAW AI integration"
- "Ableton AI plugin"
- "AI music production"
- "automated mixing software"
- "AI producer assistant"
- "$9.99 mixing software" (price-conscious searches)

## ðŸ“Š Measuring Success

Track these metrics:
- Organic search traffic
- Keyword rankings
- Click-through rate (CTR) from search results
- Conversion rate from organic traffic
- Core Web Vitals scores

## ðŸ”§ Technical Notes

- The React app is a SPA, so we're using hash routing (#features, #pricing)
- GitHub Pages doesn't support server-side rendering, but our static optimization should be sufficient
- The 404.html helps catch all routes and redirect to the main app
- Consider migrating to Next.js later for better SEO with SSR/SSG

Remember: SEO is a marathon, not a sprint. It typically takes 3-6 months to see significant results. Keep creating valuable content and building quality backlinks!
