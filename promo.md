Stop wasting time on apps that treat you like a child.

While other Japanese learning apps busy themselves with cartoon mascots and meaningless streaks, we built something that actually works. Nihon Dojo doesn't care about making you feel good about yourself. We care about making you fluent in one of the hardest possible languages imaginable.

Most Japanese learning apps are designed to keep you subscribed, not to make you fluent. They feed you bite-sized "lessons" that feel productive but teach you nothing useful. They celebrate your "progress" when you've learned to say "I like apples" for the 47th time.

We're different. And you'll probably hate us for it.

REAL SPACED REPETITION THAT HURTS

We use the tried and true FSRS algorithm, not some watered-down knockoff. Will make you review words until you hate them, then review them more. No participation trophies. 

Here is the twist: we generate sentences using only words you've already learned (revolutionary concept, we know). No more example sentences filled with 20 different N1 words you've never seen before. By giving you context clues that are targeted in real-time at your knowledge, we not only reinforce language in a natural way, we allow you to learn the meanings of new words even when you are seeing them for the first time. 

Not only that, but our built in formality switching teaches you how Japanese people actually talk; or if you're business oriented, we can do the opposite: turn you so textbook you'll be saying させていただきます in your sleep.

GRAMMAR THAT MAKES SENSE

In addition to shoving words down your throat until you are begging us to stop, we provide structured grammar lessons that build on each other. While it is an optional part of the app, it helps provide some context for the things you're learning.

CULTURAL CONTEXT

Finally, we're not just here to teach you how to conjugate. We also teach you why Japanese people say what they say. We cover the social rules other apps pretend don't exist, and prepare you for real conversations. You can't learn a language without learning the culture, they are one and the same.

KANA PRACTICE FOR VETERANS AND BEGINNERS ALIKE

If you're new, there is no easy way to learn and memorize Japanese characters, nor is there a shortcut. At the very least, we make it sort of fun and less painful to chip away at with a built in minigame.

THE GUARANTEE THAT'LL SCARE YOU

Use this app every day for two years. Follow the system. Do the reviews. If you're not conversationally fluent, we'll refund every penny. Most apps won't make this promise because they know their cute gamification doesn't work. We will, because we built tools that do.

WHO THIS IS FOR

You should use NihonDojo if you want to actually speak Japanese. If you're tired of apps that waste your time with pointless games. If you can handle being challenged instead of constantly praised. If you want personalized training that adapts to your actual progress. If you're willing to do work that might not be "fun" but gets results.

Don't download this if you want an app that makes you feel good about doing nothing. If you think learning a language should be "effortless." If you need constant validation and cartoon characters cheering you on. If you're looking for a magic bullet that requires zero effort.

OFFLINE FIRST

While this app needs an account connected to the internet to generate customized example sentences, it works perfectly fine offline or without login.

FREE FIRST

Believe it or not, making an app like this is a ton of work, and it only exists due to many long nights, fueled solely by a hate for Anki. While this app is free first, it costs money to generate sentences and continue to develop new features. Your support means everything to me, so if you can chip in, please do!

HERE'S THE DEAL

No BS.

Just the tools you need to actually learn Japanese.

Download if you're serious. Skip if you want to play games.

Built by learners who got tired of apps that don't work.

## **Reddit Post Background**

So, I really love Anki. I used it to make a lot of progress. But I have some heavy frustrations with, mainly:

The example sentences in decks like the Core 6000 use sometimes dozens of words I have never seen before.

Even when I use optimized learning orders. I find myself absolutely unable to utilize context clues, because the example sentences given contain random (sometimes N1) Kanji while I am still stuck at N3 levels of vocab. Because of this, it takes me way longer to learn new words, because it is in a total contextless vacuum without any real progression.

Well, I decided to change that.. and make an Anki ripoff application that dynamically generates sentences based on ONLY what you have studied so far, so if you only know 20 words, it is going to (try) to only make sentences using words and grammar THAT YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN!

This is a key thing used by authors when reading, for instance, grade school books or in a classroom environment. You are never exposed to too much, and allowed to use context clues to naturally learn new words. Eventually when you see it again you have a rough idea of its' meaning.

ADDITIONALLY, IT GIVES NORMAL, CASUAL, AND POLITE EXAMPLES. So tired of having to manually search how to use something like a normal Japanese person with my friends. Never again. With this, you can drill into you both casual and normal usages (as well as a keigo mode for those studying for business).

Finally, it uses RPSC spaced repetition, which apparently is supposed to be better. This app will be offered for free without sentence generation, but I use ML to generate them in realtime according to your knowledge, so I have to in theory charge something for that (or I will go broke from token costs). That being said, I am willing to front the costs for any beta testers interested in upping their studying!

In theory, since it generates new sentences every day based on your current knowledge, it will evolve as your vocabulary does both in breadth and depth.
